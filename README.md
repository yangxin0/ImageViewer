## Image Viewer

This project is used to show the BGR888 raw image frame because different image decoders can output different raw frames for the same image. We can distinguish differences within decoders with the help of this image viewer by human eyes.



### Start to build

For Mac users:

```
brew install sdl2 sdl2_image opencv
```



Notes: BGR888 raw frame cannot offer image width and height.
